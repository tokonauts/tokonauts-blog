# Hello World 👋

Welcome to **Tokonauts** — a space where I share my journey building with AI, automation, and everything in between.

## What to Expect

This blog will cover:

- **AI Assistants** — Building and customizing AI agents
- **Automation** — Making life easier with scripts and workflows  
- **Coding** — Tips, tricks, and project breakdowns
- **Building in Public** — Real progress, real challenges

## Why This Blog?

I believe in learning by doing and sharing the process. Not just the polished end results, but the messy middle too.

Stay tuned for more posts. Let's build something cool together! 🚀
